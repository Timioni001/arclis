# Engineering history

What was wrong with the first draft of the program, and what changed.

The original was described by its own README as "correct on paper, never
compiled". It did not compile, and several things were wrong beyond that.

**Build**
- `Cargo.lock` pulled `toml_edit 0.25` (edition 2024, needs rustc 1.85) through
  `anchor-lang → borsh → proc-macro-crate`, which the rustc 1.75 bundled in
  Solana 1.18 platform-tools cannot parse. Lock re-resolved against 1.75 and all
  251 crates audited. See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md).
- Lockfile was v4; Cargo 1.75 only reads v3. Now v3.
- Four compile errors from `.ok_or(PerpError::X)` in tail position, where Anchor
  needs `Error` rather than `PerpError`.
- `declare_id!` held Anchor's default placeholder and disagreed with
  `Anchor.toml`. Reconciled.
- `target/` was committed, including the program keypair: the **secret key**
  for the declared program ID. Removed, gitignored, and the key has since been
  rotated. The old ID `8KwHVevdqvNrwTCgsTvwQzvWXNsdonHKCi9mrH6gN23x` is burned; see `BUILD.md`.

**Correctness**
- **Funding ignored the price.** The index was a bare rate, so
  `funding_owed = size × rate` charged a $200 asset exactly what it charged a
  $1 asset. The index is now denominated in quote-per-base, which is why
  `crank_funding` takes an oracle account it previously did not have.
- **The vault had no solvency model.** Profit was credited to collateral from
  nothing and paid out of other traders' deposits with no balance check.
  `Market` now tracks `total_collateral`, `insurance_balance`, and `bad_debt`,
  and payouts are checked against the vault's real balance. This makes
  insolvency visible and bounded, it does not make the design solvent, which
  needs an LP counterparty.
- **Liquidation floored negative equity at zero**, silently handing the
  shortfall to other traders. Replaced with an explicit waterfall
  (`math/liquidation.rs`) that partitions every unit into trader / liquidator /
  insurance / recorded bad debt, with the partition asserted in tests.
- **Nobody would liquidate an underwater position**: the reward was a share of
  equity that no longer existed. A small insurance-funded bounty now covers
  exactly that case.
- **`GlobalConfig.paused` was never checked anywhere.** Now enforced through
  `guards.rs`. Liquidation deliberately ignores the *market* pause, so pausing
  cannot trap the vault with positions it may not close.
- **`fee_bps` was stored but never charged**, so the insurance fund had no
  funding source at all. Now charged on open and close, into insurance.
- **The leverage check used raw collateral**, ignoring unrealised PnL and
  unsettled funding, a position deep in the red could add to itself and land
  below maintenance margin in the same instruction. Now an equity-based initial
  margin check, run on final state.
- Oracle `confidence` was stored and ignored; added a confidence bound and a
  per-update deviation cap.
- Added open-interest and skew caps, a minimum position size (positions too
  small to be worth liquidating become permanent bad debt), and events on every
  state change.

**Structure**
- `state.rs` held four account layouts *and* all the arithmetic. Split into
  `state/` (one file per account) and `math/` (pure, unit-tested).
- Account sizes were hand-summed constants; now derived via `InitSpace`.
- `create_market` took three loose arguments and now configures nine risk knobs
  through a named `MarketParams` struct.
- Added `tests/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, CI, and
  `scripts/audit_msrv.py`: `Anchor.toml`'s test script previously pointed at
  files that did not exist.
